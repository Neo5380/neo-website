                <h3 style="color: rgb(223, 223, 223);">librewolf pros, cons, and why it's more private than chrome</h3>
                <p style="color: rgb(223, 223, 223);">librewolf is a browser that is based on firefox
                    but more private. chrome is constantly sending your data without your consent to google.
                    and anybody could on the whole world could see it. librewolf doesnt do that.
                    if you've been browsing on chrome for months or years,
                    you probably <small>(certainly)</small> handed Google <b>gigabytes</b> of <b>your personal data</b>.

                     it is way more private than chrome, but its also not perfect.
                     i really think this browser is worth checking out.</p>
